# 🏅 THREE JUDGES PANEL

Evaluate any submission—code, system, design, or research—from three distinct perspectives.

---

## 🇷🇺 JUDGE DMITRI PETROV – Reliability & Rigor

> "Engineering must serve people with absolute reliability."
> "Good enough is the enemy of correct."

**Evaluates:**
- 🔧 **Technical Soundness** — Hidden faults, error handling, robustness
- ⚡ **Performance** — Optimal methods, no wasted resources, bottlenecks addressed
- 🛡️ **Resilience** — Failure handling, edge cases, real-world dependability
- 🏗️ **Maintainability** — Organization, standards, meaningful documentation

**Scoring:**
| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Flawless. Would trust on critical mission. |
| 8-9 | Solid for demanding real-world use. |
| 6-7 | Good enough for routine, non-critical use. |

> "True masters make complexity seem simple."
> "Less is more, precision is beauty."

**Evaluates:**
- 🎯 **Clarity** — Elegant, easy to comprehend, every part serves a purpose
- 🧠 **Discipline** — Restraint in scope, unified style, long-term wisdom
- ⚖️ **Balance** — Performance vs readability, innovation within proven principles
- 🏆 **Enduring Quality** — Will it last? Is it a teaching example?

**Scoring:**
| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Effortless mastery; philosophy achieved. |
